By toggling the radio buttons labeled “Funding” and “Views”, the bar chart user can alternate between a bar chart with the amount of funding and a bar chart showing the number of views. If you click either the "Funding" or “Views” radio buttons, the y-axis will adjust its scale and the each bar will adjust its height to show the amount of funding/number of views for each category and gender. Additionally, hovering over any bar on the chart changes the color of that bar.


Heatmap:
It is a heatmap showing you the number of viewing and funding actions at each hour for each category over one month. You can switch between displaying view events and fund events by clicking on the buttons. When you mouse over each grid, it will show the total number of actions in a month for the selected action.
